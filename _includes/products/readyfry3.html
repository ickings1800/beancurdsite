		<h3>Description:</h3>
		<p>Ready Fried Tofu is a new product that aims to assist chefs in their dish preparation.
			Deep frying bean curd is a complicated and tedious process
			due to factors that can affect the quality of the end product, such as the oil used, timing, technique etc.<br>
			<br>By pre-frying our Deep-Fried Tofu, chefs can skip the initial frying process.
			This product is sealed and packed in packs of three to ensure proper hygiene and freshness.</p>
