# About us
## Our Company
Our factory is located in Singapore, manufacturing and supplying tofu products such
as deep-fried, silken and pressed tofu to restaurants, distributors and
stores locally.


We constantly focus on research and development to innovate new tofu products.
We also incorporate the use of automated machines to ensure our tofu products
are safe and hygienic for consumption.


## Beginnings
Sun Up Bean Food was established in 2003, manufacturing traditional pressed cut
tofu and deep fried tofu in Singapore. Using a traditional recipe and experience
that has been inherited for over forty years, we know what it takes to manufacture
good, authentic tofu that differs from our competitors. By using high-quality soya
beans, our products will give out a unique soya bean fragrance when consumed.


Over the years, we have expanded our tofu product range and improved the efficiency
and hygiene of our processes by utilizing automated machinery and encouraging the
use of sealed packaging. Nevertheless, we remain true to our roots and have preserved
the traditional, authentic taste that people love.

## Mission
To innovate in the Singapore bean curd manufacturing industry and providing
customers with safe, affordable, and quality tofu products.
