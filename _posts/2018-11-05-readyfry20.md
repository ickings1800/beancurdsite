### Description:
Ready Fried Tofu is a new product that helps restaurant chefs in their recipe preparation. 
Deep frying bean curd is difficult due to factors that can affect 
the quality of the end product, such as the oil used, timing, technique etc.


By pre-frying our Deep Fried Tofu, restaurant chefs can skip the initial frying process. 
This product is vacuum sealed and packed in packs of twenty to ensure proper hygiene and freshness.
