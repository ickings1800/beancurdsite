### Description:
Ready Fried Tofu is a new product that aims to assist chefs in their dish preparation. 
Deep frying bean curd is a complicated and tedious process due to factors that can affect 
the quality of the end product, such as the oil used, timing, technique etc.


By pre-frying our Deep Fried Tofu, chefs can skip the initial frying process. 
This product is sealed and packed in packs of three to ensure proper hygiene and freshness.
